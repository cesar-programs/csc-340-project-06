# CSC 340 Project 06

## Overview

This is the final group project for the CSC 340 course in Spring 2024. The goal for this programming project is to simulate an oversimplified predator-prey ecosystem. Specifically, this ecosystem contains only two organisms, one being the prey and the other the predator.

## Project Description

Zoomies and Swoopies live in a world composed of a 30 x 30 grid of cells. Only one critter may occupy a cell at a time. The grid is enclosed, so a critter is not allowed to move off the edges of the world. Time is simulated in time steps. Each critter performs some action at every time step. 


## TODO

- [ ] Create a class hierarchy with the base class Organism and two derived classes, Zoomie and Swoopie.
- [ ] Initialize the small world with 5 Swoopies and 100 Zoomies.
- [ ] After each time step, prompt the user to press Enter to move to the next time step.
